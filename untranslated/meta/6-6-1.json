The indicator is multifaceted capturing\ndata on different types of freshwater ecosystems and to measure extent change the\nindicator considers spatial area changes, water quality and water quantity changes.\nThe indicator uses satellite based Earth observations to globally monitor different\nfreshwater ecosystems types Earth observation data series on surface area are available\non permanent water, seasonal water, reservoirs, wetlands, mangroves; as well as\ngenerating data on water quality the using trophic state and turbidity of water\nbodies. Satellite images can be represented as numerical data, which in turn are\naggregated into meaningful statistics of ecosystem change attributed to administrative\nareas such as national, sub-national (e.g. regions and provinces) and river basin\nboundaries. Global data products for river flows and groundwater level have not\nyet been produced at useful spatial and temporal resolutions to be incorporated\ninto this SDG 6.6.1 methodology. Currently, these data should continue to be provided\nfrom modelling or from ground-based measurements and required from the countries.\n<br>\n<br><b>Extent</b> - As used in the title of this indicator, 'extent' is expanded beyond spatial extent\nto capture additional basic parameters needed for the protection and restoration of water-related\necosystems. Extent includes three components - the spatial extent or surface area, the quality, \nand the quantity of water-related ecosystems.\n<br>\n<br><b>Surface Water</b> refers to any area of surface water unobstructed by aquatic vegetation. This includes the \nfollowing 3 water-related ecosystem categories: rivers and estuaries, lakes, and artificial waterbodies.\n<br>\n<br><b>Reservoirs</b> are artificial (or human-made) bodies of freshwater, as opposed to lakes which are naturally \noccurring. The reservoirs dataset represents surface area data on artificial water bodies including reservoirs \nformed by dams, flooded areas such as opencast mines and quarries, flood irrigation areas, and water \nbodies created by hydro-engineering projects such as waterway and harbour construction.\n<br>\n<br><b>Turbidity</b> is an indicator of water clarity, quantifying the haziness of the water and acting as an indicator of \nunderwater light availability.\n<br>\n<br><b>Trophic State</b> refers to the degree at which organic matter accumulates in the water body and is most \ncommonly used in relation to monitoring eutrophication.\n<br>\n<br><b>Change</b> means a shift from one condition of extent to another over time within a water-related ecosystem, \nmeasured against a point of reference. Surface-water extent changes are compared against a 20-year reference \nperiod (baseline).\n","DATA_COMP":"Combined surface-water changes = permanent + seasonal + reservoir changes.
