First, the question \nassumes that respondents do the following: (1) go out, (2) go out alone, (3) go out in their neighbourhood,\nand (4) go out after dark. For many respondents, the reasons for not going out alone in their neighbourhood \nafter dark may have nothing or little to do with crime and more to do with personal and circumstantial \nissues, such aslack of mobility, childcare commitments, or the use of a car that allows them to travel further \nafield. Second, the question does not define the meaning of \u201cneighbourhood\u201d, which may mean different \nthings to different respondents, even those living in the same street. Third, the question does not explicitly \nrefer to \u2018crime\u2019, but rather it is implicit in the question. There may be other reasons unrelated to crime (e.g. \nwild animals, traffic, etc.) why respondents may not feel safe walking around their neighbourhood after \ndark.\n<br>\n<br>\"Total \u2013 Visible minority\" includes population aged 15 years and over. \"Visible minority\" refers to whether \na person is a visible minority or not, as defined by the Employment Equity Act. The Employment Equity Act defines\nvisible minorities as \"persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in \ncolour.\" The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, \nFilipino, Arab, Latin American, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese.
